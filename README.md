# Flashcards

A simple software for displaying flashcards. Unlike some variants of flashcards, this app does not include a "backside" of the cards to diplay a solution. Instead this app is meant to be used in groups of two or more people, explaining each card to the others.

### Project status

The app is working and available to use, but there are still a few features I want to add:

- Displaying statistics for all players
- Bulk import of questions

### Installation

For the time being, the only way to run the software is to download the files, run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project directory and run the `main.py` file.

### How to use

For each question, the card displays which person should answer/explain the card. After the answer you select if it was wrong or correct, and you draw the next card for the next person.

The slider at the bottom of the screen lets you choose if the cards should be drawn randomly, or if it should be more likely to draw a card where the player has fewer correct answers.

Functionality for adding, editing or deleting cards are all explained in the app.

### About me

I am a 32 year old informatics student at the University of Oslo, currently in the last year of my bachelor's degree. This app has been developed to help me practise for my exams.
